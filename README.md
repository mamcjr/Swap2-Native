# Swap2-Native

Play your own copies of Nintendo Switch 2 games natively on Android phones.

It is not an emulator: the game's own ARM64 code runs directly on the phone's CPU (rewritten only where Android's kernel requires it), a host answers the Switch 2's system calls and services, the game's NVN2 graphics commands are replayed on Vulkan, and its shaders are translated to SPIR-V, offline on a computer or on the phone itself. The app is `com.swap2native`; one APK runs every game.

Forked from Banana Native v0.1.1 by moceure, itself built on nxnative by seedds (MIT).

> [!CAUTION]
> Only download the app from this repository's [Releases](https://github.com/mamcjr/Swap2-Native/releases). Copies elsewhere are not made here.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Experimental. Most of this code was written with AI coding assistants and tested by hand on two phones. Expect bugs, heat and slowdowns.

## Games

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the focus of this fork. Status on the phone, from each game's note:

| Game | Title ID | Version | Status on Android |
|---|---|---|---|
| [The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time](dm/games/0400486024DEC000/README.md) | `0400486024DEC000` | update v131072 | **In bring-up, gets into gameplay.** Opening and title movies at 60 fps; Link's house at about 30 fps (up to about 38 fps with FSR 1 in place of the game's upscaler network). Open: some UI text missing, an occasional process exit, the phone throttling |
| [Donkey Kong Bananza](dm/games/040074A01BF12000/README.md) | `040074A01BF12000` | update v458752 | **Plays**: about 30 fps on the POCO F7 Ultra with Turnip |
| [Mario Kart World](dm/games/0400C3F00006E000/README.md) | `0400C3F00006E000` | 1.8.0 | **In bring-up, not playable**: the game starts, then runs out of memory before its first frame |
| [Pokémon Pokopia](dm/games/0400A3A01EE4C000/README.md) | `0400A3A01EE4C000` | update v655360 (Ver. 2.0.1) | **Experimental**: the opening and the first walking scene, then it stops before the character comes out of a Poké Ball (open) |

A dump of another game build is refused by the build check, with a message that says which build the app needs. The [games table](dm/games/README.md#games) lists every profile in this tree, most of them nxnative's Switch 1 games for Apple platforms.

## Tested phones

| Phone | Chip | Tested with |
|---|---|---|
| POCO F7 Ultra | Snapdragon 8 Elite (Adreno 830) | Qualcomm system driver, or Turnip (Turnip Gen8 from the app's driver download) |
| RedMagic 11 Air | Snapdragon 8 Elite (Adreno 830) | used to prepare Zelda: Ocarina of Time (2026-11-07); driver not recorded |

Other phones are untested. Settings › **Readiness check** says what a phone lacks before a game starts (for example a driver without placed memory maps, which some Qualcomm drivers lack: Settings › GPU driver installs a Turnip).

## What you need

- Android 13 or newer on a 64-bit phone with a Snapdragon (Adreno) GPU and 12-16 GB of RAM.
- Your own game, dumped from your own console: a dump folder (`base/`, `updates/<version>/`, `dlc/<title ID>/<n>/`) or a `.nup` file ([android/NUP.md](android/NUP.md)). No keys or firmware are needed or used.
- Free space for the preparation: the dump is read in place; a game's pack and shader library take hundreds of MB to a few GB, and Prepare needs a few GB more while it runs.

## Install

1. Download the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/mamcjr/Swap2-Native/releases) and install it.
2. Open **Swap2-Native** and allow **All files access** (the app reads your games from shared storage).
3. Optional: Settings › **GPU driver** to pick the system driver or install a Turnip, and Settings › **Readiness check**.

## Prepare a game

New to the app? **Getting started** explains file selection and preparation. Open it from the empty library, Add game, or Settings → About. For a `.nup`, select the file itself; do not extract it. If Recent or Downloads cannot locate it, browse through Internal storage to its local folder. The app explains import failures and offers another selection without changing your dump.

Each game is prepared once: its code is rewritten for Android and its shaders are translated for Vulkan. The app does this on the phone ([android/LIBRARY.md](android/LIBRARY.md)):

1. Copy your dump (folder or `.nup`) into `/sdcard/Switch2/Games` on the phone.
2. In the app, choose that folder as your library. The app recognizes the games by title ID, uses the built-in profile for each and fetches its cover.
3. Tap **Play** on a game. The first time, it prepares the game first: code rewrite, shader split and translation. It runs in the background with a notification and can be paused; keep the phone charging and the app exempt from battery optimization. Nothing is uploaded. Zelda's 42,000 shaders take the longest.
4. When it is done, **Play** starts the game.

A phone that should not translate shaders can import them instead: the game's ⋯ › **Import shaders…** takes a zip made by **Export shaders…** on another phone, and Prepare then only rewrites the code ([android/SHADERS.md](android/SHADERS.md#shader-zips)).

### The Switch2 folder

| Folder | What |
|---|---|
| `Switch2/Games/` | your games: dump folders and `.nup` files |
| `Switch2/Work/<title ID>/` | a game's work folder: Prepare's working files, and a pack made on a computer (`android-pack`) |
| `Switch2/Mods/<title ID>/` | the game's exefs mods (IPS, IPS32, `.pchtxt`) |
| `Switch2/Shaders/` | shader zips from Export shaders… |
| `Switch2/profiles/<title ID>/` | a profile for a game the APK does not carry |

Prepared packs and saves stay in the app's own storage (`Android/data/com.swap2native/files/packs` and `saves`); a game's ⋯ menu backs saves up to `Switch2/save-backups/<title ID>/` and exports or imports them. Details: [android/README.md, The Switch2 folder](android/README.md#the-switch2-folder).

A pack can also be made on a computer with `scripts/pack_android.py` and copied to `Switch2/Work/<title ID>/android-pack` ([android/README.md, Pack a game](android/README.md#pack-a-game)).

## Features

- Game settings per game: resolution (phone 1080p, 720p or the game's own), frame rate cap, GPU driver, extra environment lines.
- **Upscaling:** AMD FidelityFX FSR 1 for the final picture, and for agl's games (Zelda, Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza) FSR 1 in place of the game's upscaler network, which is faster on Adreno. Zelda can also draw its 3D scene at 720p.
- **Frame generation (LSFG):** Lossless Scaling's frame generation, with your own `Lossless.dll` (not included).
- On-screen controls with a layout editor, gamepads, exefs mods, save backups, pause on return, and a performance overlay.

## Known issues

- The phone gets hot, and the frame rate drops when it throttles.
- Some Android skins freeze the app in the background, which stops a preparation: exempt it from battery optimization or keep it in front.
- A new app version can need a game's shaders made again; the app says so and offers Prepare.
- Per-game issues are in each game's note (linked in [Games](#games)).

## Building

See [android/README.md, Build the APK](android/README.md#build-the-apk). Release keys are never in this repository.

## Support the project

Swap2-Native is a free, independent project. If you enjoy it and would like to support its development, you can
sponsor me on GitHub, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee or via **Pix**. Your support helps me dedicate time to fixing bugs, improving performance and compatibility, and
working on future releases. Sponsorship is entirely optional: it does not unlock features or guarantee specific fixes.
Bug reports, device tests, and contributions are also greatly appreciated.

Current goal: buy a **POCO X7 Pro ($455)**, a test device equipped with a MediaTek Dimensity SoC and Mali GPU to improve testing and optimize performance across all our ports (BOTWRecompAndroid, TOTKDroid, LASRecompAndroid, and Swap2-Native). The badge below shows total donations received across all platforms; I update it by hand.
